This project aims to develop a predictive model by analyzing a database of heart disease-related information. The primary objective is to assess whether a patient is likely to have a heart disease based on various medical parameters such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and oldpeak among others.

By carrying out this project, we will be able to help medicine to decide whether a patient is at risk of heart disease and to act before the condition develops.

To achieve this, we will initially divide our dataset into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train several machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, and perceptron models, among others. For each model, we will compute performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Afterwards, in order to select the most effective model, we will compare the performance metrics of all the trained algorithms and choose the one that exhibits the highest predictive capability. Finally, we will apply the selected model to the test dataset to generate predictions and conduct a thorough analysis of the results to evaluate the model's performance and predictive accuracy.
